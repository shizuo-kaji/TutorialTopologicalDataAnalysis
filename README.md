# Tutorial on Topological Data Analysis  
*Written by Shizuo Kaji*

---

## Main Examples  

Our main example notebook [**TopologicalDataAnalysisWithPython.ipynb**](TopologicalDataAnalysisWithPython.ipynb) is designed to run on **Google Colaboratory**, so you don’t need to set up a Python environment on your computer.  

[**Open in Google Colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shizuo-kaji/TutorialTopologicalDataAnalysis/blob/master/TopologicalDataAnalysisWithPython.ipynb)

This notebook covers:  
- **Feature extraction** using persistent homology from various types of data:  Point clouds, Graphs, Images, Volumes, Time-series data  
- **Regression and classification** using topological features  
- **Dimension reduction** while preserving topological features  
- **Visualization** to reveal the shape of data  

This Jupyter Notebook was originally prepared for the online event:  
**[TDA for Applications: Tutorial and Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/tda-application-tutorial/)**  
held on **18–19 June 2020**.

## Older demos

The following examples are no longer maintained, and not compatible with Google Colaboratory.

### NLP Example: Vectorization and Visualization  

As an example of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, we analyze math papers from arXiv and [**visualize the data using the mapper**](arxiv_mapper.html).

For setup instructions, refer to the [**NLP Example Guide**](NLP_example.md).
