# Tutorial on Topological Data Analysis
*Written by Shizuo Kaji*

## Overview
This repository provides hands-on tutorials for topological data analysis (TDA), with notebooks that run in Google Colaboratory so no local Python setup is required.

## Main Notebooks
| Notebook | Description | Colab |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**TopologicalDataAnalysisWithPython.ipynb**](TopologicalDataAnalysisWithPython.ipynb) | End-to-end TDA workflow with examples across multiple data types and machine learning tasks. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shizuo-kaji/TutorialTopologicalDataAnalysis/blob/master/TopologicalDataAnalysisWithPython.ipynb) |
| [**PersistentHomology_Interactive.ipynb**](PersistentHomology_Interactive.ipynb) | Interactive examples focused on persistent homology concepts. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shizuo-kaji/TutorialTopologicalDataAnalysis/blob/master/PersistentHomology_Interactive.ipynb) |

## What You Will Learn
The tutorial notebook includes:
- **Interactive intuition-building** for persistent homology of Vietoris-Rips and cubical complexes
- **Feature extraction** using persistent homology from point clouds, graphs, images, volumes, and time-series data
- **Regression and classification** using topological features
- **Dimension reduction** while preserving topological features
- **Visualisation** to reveal the shape of data

## Background
This tutorial was originally prepared for the online event:
**[TDA for Applications: Tutorial and Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/tda-application-tutorial/)** (18-19 June 2020).

## Legacy Demo
The following example is no longer maintained and is not compatible with Google Colaboratory:
- **NLP Example: Vectorisation and Visualisation**
  Analyse mathematics papers from arXiv and [visualise the data using mapper](arxiv_mapper.html).
  Setup instructions: [NLP_example.md](NLP_example.md)
